  # No `depends_on xcode:`. The Swift 6.2 compiler this package needs comes with
  # the Command Line Tools, which Homebrew requires anyway, and demanding a full
  # Xcode.app refused the build on a machine that builds it every day.

    # `--disable-sandbox` because Homebrew's own sandbox already confines the
    # build, and SwiftPM's refuses to write its cache under it.

    bin.install ".build/release/Tessera" => "tessera"

  # `brew services start tessera` keeps the menu bar utility running. It is a
  # user agent rather than a daemon: the switcher draws on the screen and reads
  # the keyboard, neither of which a root daemon may do.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Tessera needs two permissions before it can do anything, and it says which
      are missing at any time:

        tessera permissions

      Screen Recording lists the windows and captures their previews; without it
      the switcher is empty. Accessibility raises a particular window; without it
      only the owning application comes forward. Both are granted in
      System Settings > Privacy & Security.

      Because this is a plain binary rather than an app bundle, macOS attributes
      those prompts to whatever started it — your terminal, or Homebrew's
      services agent — so grant them to that.

      Start it:

        brew services start tessera     # keeps running, and comes back at login
        tessera run                     # or just this, in a terminal

      An example configuration, with every key documented:

        cp #{opt_pkgshare}/config.example.toml ~/.config/tessera/config.toml
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # No subcommand prints the help, which is the one thing that works without
    # any permission at all.
    assert_match "native macOS window switcher", shell_output(bin/"tessera")
    assert_match "Screen Recording", shell_output("#{bin/"tessera"} permissions")
  end
end
